# Web3 FundMe dApp

The application essentially provides a decentralized platform where users can create Fundraisers by adding the required details and they can also donate to the existing Fundraisers. 

The donation amount is stored in the smart-contract until the goal set by the organizer is reached or the expiry date set by the organizer has passed. 
If the goal amount is reached before the expiry date, the collected funds are transferred to the beneficiary's address.
